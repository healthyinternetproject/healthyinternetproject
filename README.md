# Healthy Internet Project

The [Healthy Internet Project](http://www.healthyinternetproject.org) is a browser extension on Chrome and Firefox which allows you to flag content online, 
no matter the URL. Help us report lies, take down abuse, stop fear mongering, and uplift the greatest ideas on the web.
It is licensed under the Non Profit Open Source License 3.0, which you can find in NPOSL-3.0.txt. 

Please be mindful. 
A healthier internet is only possible if each of us have the wellbeing of others in mind.

Here are some additional links which are helpful in understanding our values and goals:\

If you're interested in contributing, please join our online community! Building a thriving space for discussion around these issues is just as important as the actual browser extension.

## Deploy ....

### Chrome:

Extensions -> (Developer Mode) -> Load Unpacked. \
Select the /extension directory (needs to have a manifest.json).\
This should trigger our onboarding, and it should add our HIP icon to your group of extensions. \
In the late 2020 chrome update, you may now see a puzzle icon, which is hiding your extensions. \
Look in the puzzle if you can't see the HIP extension....


### Firefox:

Create a zip of all the files inside the /extension directory. \
about:debugging -> This Firefox -> Load  emporary Add-on -> select this zip. \
firefox and chrome have some slightly different needs for the manifest. so you may need to update the manifest 
to get firefox rolling.
