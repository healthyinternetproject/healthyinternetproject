## Deploy ....

### Chrome:

Extensions -> (Developer Mode) -> Load Unpacked. \
Select the /extension directory (needs to have a manifest.json).\
This should trigger our onboarding, and it should add our HIP icon to your group of extensions. \
In the late 2020 chrome update, you may now see a puzzle icon, which is hiding your extensions. \
Look in the puzzle if you can't see the HIP extension....


### Firefox:

Create a zip of all the files inside the /extension directory. \
about:debugging -> This Firefox -> Load  emporary Add-on -> select this zip. \
firefox and chrome have some slightly different needs for the manifest. so you may need to update the manifest 
to get firefox rolling.
